# npm-webpack4
This project is an educational tool for myself to learn npm, webpack and potentially explore other build/bundle tools such as parcel. The important goals considered are increasing the ability to understand npm to modularize and compartmentalize dependencies across all environments. Another important goal is to determine whether the webpack bundle tool is feasible for future projects in terms of cost, time and maintenance. Other considerations include browserify/gulp and parcel.
